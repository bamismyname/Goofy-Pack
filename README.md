# Goofy Pack
A resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition.
-------------------------------------------
This is just a simple resource pack made by some friends and me, as well as the Bluecore SMP server. Feel free to use the pack or borrow textures for your own.

# How to install
Download the latest release from the releases tab on the right. You can download the current files by downloading the zip however I wouldn't recommend as it isn't always tested.
Once it's downloaded you need to extract the zip folder, go into the next folder, select all the items and rezip them (complicated I know but it's how github formats downloads) From there you have the resource pack and can upload them into your resourcepacks folder which can be acessed from Minecraft by going into the Resource Packs tab in settings and opening Resource Packs Folder. Alternatively you can find it in File Manager in the "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks" directory.
